TODO
- Convert test data files so they don't need to be parsed on load
- Validate arguments as they are added to the set
- Handle repeatedly adding arguments with the same name 
- Create separate functions for lookup of values in the argument set to hide the use of propslist
- Separate parsing of expression and processing of expression so that parsing is only done once with the curried version of sub
